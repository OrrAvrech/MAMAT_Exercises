Shortest Path Results:
The shortest path from source 0     to 0     costs: 0     and the previous vertex is: 0    
The shortest path from source 0     to 1     costs: 3     and the previous vertex is: 0    
The shortest path from source 0     to 2     costs: 4     and the previous vertex is: 0    
The shortest path from source 0     to 3     costs: 6     and the previous vertex is: 1    
The shortest path from source 0     to 4     costs: 6     and the previous vertex is: 2
